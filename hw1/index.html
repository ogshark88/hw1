        <p>This is the Coca-Cola freestyle drink machine which can be found at Andrew's dining hall. 
          There is a similar but notably different version of this machine at Ratty.
          The machine features a touch screen which offers 100+ flavors of different drinks from Coca-Cola affiliated companies.
          Pressing any brand will bring you to a screen with flavor options that brand has to offer.
          Under the touchscreeen, a user can press their cup into a paddle which will dispense ice. 
          In order to dispense the selected drink, the user must push the large illuminated button above the ice paddle.
          Under the dispenser, there is a resevoir which serves to catch accidental spillage.

            <b>User 1 - Male Athlete</b>
            <br><i>Observations:</i></br>
            <br>Looks for a while on the screen in order to locate water. 
            Finds the water option and then fill the cup with ice by pressing the ice pedal. 
            Then presses the large button to dispense water.

          <br>
          <p><i>Interview Summary:</i></p>
          <li>Feels the touchscreen layout is not that easy to use especially since she doesnt recognize a lot of the drinks</li>
          <li>Easy to understand the touchscreen but it was kind of difficult to locate the water option in the bottom left</li>
          <li>Not used to pressing button to get a drink, more used to the pedals as with other soda machines</li>
          <li>Sometimes the drinks are flat/ice is out</li>
          </br>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <p>
            <b>User 2 - Freshman Student</b>
            <br><i>Observations:</i></br>
            <br>Takes some time to press on different options. Notices some of them are greyed out meaning it's out of stock so choose a different brand and different drink. Seems to be used to the format of the touchscreen
            Dispenses some ice first, some ice spills out.
            Presses the large button to dispense drink and then leaves.

          <li>Overall rated the machine as a 5</li>
          <li>Likes the options as well as the quality of drinks</li>
          <li>Likes the ratty Coca-Cola freestyle machine better because you dispense both drink and ice with pedals</li>

          <p>
            <b>User 3 - Drew's Employee</b>
            <br><i>Observations:</i></br>
            <br>Just uses the ice, doesnt even pick a drink.
            After dispensing ice the lady goes to the water machine right next to it and dispenses water.

          <br>

          <br><b>Persona 1 - A student-athlete going to eat at Andrew's dining hall.</b></br>
          <br>Interface Problems: This persona faces a problem where the water option was not in an obvious position on the touchscreen.</br>
          <br>This persona represents the student athlete that I interviewed as user 1. Some of the main pain points are the need to quickly sit down and eat as well as the want for cold drinks. Two of the hinderances in this interface are the possibility of no ice and an unorganized touchscreen home screen. </br>
        </p>
         <p>
          <br><b>Persona 2 - A dining hall employee going to get a drink.</b></br>
          <br>Interface Problems: This persona faces a problem the touchscreen is cluttered. Also, the pedal to get ice but a button to dispense a drink is confusing as the machine at Ratty has ice and liquid dispensed using a pedal mechanism.</br>
          <br>This persona represents the Drew's employee that I interviewd. This persona prefers a simple design such as the old fashioned soda machines at fast food restaurants where the options are obvious and easy to access.</br>
